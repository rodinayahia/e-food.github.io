            <p class="akla-pra">Shawarma is one of the most famous street foods in the Middle East. The roots of this delicious dish go back to the Levant and the Ottoman Empire, when, in 1906, Sadeeq Khabaz left his restaurant job in Bursa and traveled to Damascus to open a shawarma restaurant. Khabaz adapted the recipe, introducing the distinct taste of the Syrian shawarma.
